Multilang Documentation
=======================

Multilang is a suite of tools to help in the building of a multi-lingual
Django project. It contains several components:

Translatable URLs
-----------------

Use the `turl` function in urlresolvers in place of the usual `url` function
when declaring URL patterns, combined with the `ugettext_noop` gettext function
and the URLs you declare will become translatable using the normal gettext
translation system.

Language Setting Via URL
------------------------

Use LangInURLMiddleware and special root URLconf to embed the language code
in the URL path.

This supersedes Django's usual language detection, so any URL with a language
code in it has a predictable language when visited. This also means that the
individual, language-specific resources of the site can all be identified
by URL.

See `multilang/tests/settings.py` and `multilang/tests/lang_prefixed_urls.py`
for an example.

Translatable DB
---------------

The two-model translation system that's provided here requires that you
manually specify a foreign key from your `LangDependent` model to your
`LangAgnostic` or "core" model. This FK should be named "core" and should
define its related_name as "translations". You also must define this
LangAgnostic model even if you have no "language agnostic" fields to put
in it, since it is used for finding translations.

See `multilang/tests/models.py` for an example.

Translation Switching
---------------------

Add MultilangMiddleware to the list of middleware classes and add the
"translate" context processor to the list of template context processors
to use the "`this_page_in_lang`" template tag. It will attempt to find
the URL that represents the page being displayed, but in the language requested.

Use the provided decorators to annotate any views whose translations should
be determined in a special way.

TODO: An additional template tag should be provided that generates a list
of the available translations of the current page.

TODO: Should there be a way for translations to "fall back" to other locations
on the site if a page-specific translation can't be found?

TODO: What is the purpose of multilang_permalink? When should we use it?

Language Hiding
---------------

The BlockLocaleMiddleware will block non-admins from accessing the site in any language
listed in the `BLOCKED_LANGUAGES` setting in the settings file.

Admin
-----

Two ModelAdmin classes are provided under multilang.admin to create a better 
workflow in the Django administration when adding and editing multilang models.
Subclass LangDependentModelAdmin and LangAgnosticModelAdmin accordingly when 
creating admin classes for translatable model pairs.

Also make sure that the multilang/media folder is symlinked from your project's
media folder as multilang:

    ln -s path/to/multilang/media project_name/media/multilang

See `multilang/tests/admin.py` for an example.
